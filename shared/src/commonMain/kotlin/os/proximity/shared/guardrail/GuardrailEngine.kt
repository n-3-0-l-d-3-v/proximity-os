 * The single mediation point for every sensitive action in Proximity OS.

 * it is acted on. There is no code path that bypasses this: transport
 * implementations must not expose raw channels to UI or application code
 * directly.
 *
 * See docs/GUARDRAIL_POLICY.md for the policy model this evaluates and
 * docs/THREAT_MODEL.md for the threats it is designed to mitigate.
