/**
 * A policy the user can turn on or off, described in the words a

 *
 * The catalog exists so that policy is not scattered through the codebase
 * as ad-hoc conditionals: every switch a user can flip is one entry here,
 * with the sentence explaining it living next to the rule it produces. If
 * the two ever disagree, the app is lying to its user about its own
 * behaviour.
