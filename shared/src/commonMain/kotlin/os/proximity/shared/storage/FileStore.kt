 * Minimal persistence surface.
 *
 * Deliberately small and text-oriented: everything Proximity OS stores is
 * either a short document or an append-only log, and keeping the platform
 * contract this thin means the storage *logic* (compaction, bounding,
 * recovery from corruption) lives in shared code where it is testable.
 *
 * Implementations must not throw for a missing file — that is the ordinary
 * first-run condition, not an error.
